# cost-of-living-tracker

This project is a simple, experimentative tool designed to help manage monthly and yearly living costs in London. It was created as part of my personal exploration into financial planning, UI/UX design, and interactive web tools, with the goal of positioning my GitHub portfolio toward consulting and policy-oriented projects.

**Purpose**

To experiment with cost-of-living calculations for students and young professionals.
To provide a practical budgeting tool for me and my partner while living in London.
To showcase front-end development and data export features in a minimalistic, modern design.

**Features**

Input monthly expenses: Rent, Council Tax, Wi-Fi, Phone Bill, Credit Card, Groceries.
Add extra expense categories dynamically.
Calculate monthly and yearly totals.
Partner split options: equal or custom percentage.
Export data as CSV for spreadsheet analysis.
Responsive, floating UI with a London-themed background.

**Why Experimental?**
This is not a polished product but a proof-of-concept for personal use and portfolio development. It reflects my interest in data-driven decision-making, financial modeling, and policy-relevant tools.
